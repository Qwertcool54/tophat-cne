# LJ's Events Pack
Hi!!

## THIS IS A ADDON!!!
You can put it in `./addons/` OR THE NEW FEATURE `./mods/your-mod/addons/`!!

# DOWNLOAD THE `./data` AND `./images` FOLDER

Thanks for using my events pack, I hope you enjoy it!

## Additional Info:

Since some events might go past the height of the events screen (ahem Cinematic Event), I've added a scrolling feature.

You can use the scroll bar on the right or use the mouse wheel to scroll.

<details>
    <summary><h3>Lyric Event</h3></summary>
    <p>This was made for Pillar Funkin! It's a bit complicated to explain here, but it uses a .json in `./songs/your-song/lyric.json`, you can find an example in `./github/`</p>

<details>
    <summary><h3>Set Camera To Middle</h3></summary>
    <p>This basically acts like the YoshiCrafterEngine's version of the % between 2 characters. Pick 2 strumline's characters, and the float will be point between them.</p>
    <p>Events are self explanatory.</p>

<details>
    <summary><h3>Set Character Camera Offset</h3></summary>
    <p>This modifies the Character's camera position. You can also tween to the value as well.</p>
    <!--  -->
    <p>Camera Target - The character index of the `strumLine.characters` array to edit.</p>
    <p>Additive - Adds the value to the current camera offset.</p>
    <p>Take Snapshot - Saves the camera's position value as a snapshot. (A snapshot is taken on creation of PlayState)</p>
    <p>Reset To Snapshot - Resets the camera's position to the snapshot. (Per character!!)</p>
    <p>Tween Time - The time in beats that the tween takes. If left at 0, camFollow's lerp will be used instead.</p>
    <p>The rest is self explanatory.</p>

    <summary><h3>Shake Camera</h3></summary>
    <p>Shakes the camera, pretty self explanatory. You can do specific cameras, or all the cameras in the list of rendering cameras.</p>

<details>
    <summary><h3>Change Character</h3></summary>
    <p>This event, personally I won't use, because there is way better ways to do it than an event, but useful for those who can't code in Codename Engine.</p>
    <p>The Character Index is based on the StrumLine's Characters array, so you can change any character.</p>
    <!--  -->
    <p>Precaching the character just preloads the character to a map array. So if the character with the same name is already in the map, it will reference that character and load that one instead.</p>
    <!--  -->
    <p>NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS SOMEHOW!!</p>
    <p>If you change the "x" or "y" param in the `data/character` XML, that is the Charatcer's GLOBAL position!!! This affects where the character is placed in ANY stage. So that's probably why when you switch characters, they are at an offset.</p>
    <!--  -->
    <p>To counteract this, the Offset X and Offset Y params are there. They will always apply an offset when the event is called (unless the character you are switching to is already active).</p>
